# 🎮 2-Player Shooter Game (C++ Console Game)

This is a simple C++ console-based 2-player shooting game built using only standard libraries like `<windows.h>`, `<conio.h>`, and `<iostream>`. It's a fun project that I created as a way to practice real-time logic and game mechanics.

## 🧪 Current Status

The main game file (`game`) is **bug-free and runs smoothly**, but it does **not include** timer or score calculation features yet.

There is also a beta version (`game2_beta`) which includes:
- ⏱️ Timer system
- 🏆 Score tracking for both players

⚠️ `game2_beta` was made with help from **ChatGPT**, and while it introduces timer and scoring, it still has a few bugs and performance issues.

Both `game_file_for_pr` and `game2_beta` have the same code and are open for contributions.

## 🎯 Game Rules & Features

- 2-player real-time shooting game in console
- Bombs spawn randomly and explode on bullet collision
- Side-bomb effect (mini explosions on either side)
- Player A controls: `W A S D` to move, `F` to shoot  
- Player B controls: `I J K L` to move, `H` to shoot

## 📅 Future Plans

I plan to expand the game in **2026 or 2027** with features like:
- 💥 Power-ups (shields, rapid fire, speed boost)
- ❤️ Health system & healing pickups
- 🤖 AI enemy bots
- 🧨 Multi-hit bombs with larger explosions
- 🎨 Visual animations and particle effects
- 🎵 Real sound effects using audio files

If you're interested in fixing bugs or adding features to the game, you're **most welcome**!  
You can contribute to:
- `game2_beta` – includes timer and score but needs improvements

## 🙏 Final Note

I'm currently focusing on **DSA and internship preparation**, so major updates will come later.

Thanks for checking out the project — I hope you enjoy it! ❤️
