# 🎮 2-Player Shooter Game (C++ Console Game)

This is a simple C++ console-based 2-player shooting game built using only standard libraries like `<windows.h>`, `<conio.h>`, and `<iostream>`. It's a fun project that I created with the help of ChatGPT, and though it's not perfect yet, it's been an exciting learning journey! 🚀

## 🧪 Current Status

The current version (`game`) is playable but still has a few bugs and performance issues. I plan to polish it in future updates.

I've also created a beta version (`game2_beta`) that includes:
- ⏱️ A working game timer
- 🏆 Score tracking for both players  
However, it's not completely smooth or bug-free at the moment.

## 📅 Future Plans

I plan to work on a more refined version (`game2_beta`) possibly in **2026 or 2027**, once I’ve gained more experience and improved my coding skills for internships and real-world projects.

Here's what I'm planning for future updates:
- 💥 Power-ups (shields, rapid fire, speed boost)
- ❤️ Health and healing system
- 🤖 AI-controlled bot enemy
- 🧨 Multi-hit bombs with cool animations
- 🎨 Smoother animations and better visual effects
- 🎵 Realistic sound effects (using audio files instead of `Beep()`)

## 🤝 Want to Contribute?

If you're interested in fixing bugs or adding features to the game, contributions are **most welcome**! 🎉  
You can work on either:
- `game2_beta` – the timer + score version
- `game_file_for_pr` – same as above, intended for contributions

Feel free to fork the repo and open a pull request!

## 🙏 Final Note

I'm currently focusing on improving my overall coding skills and preparing for internships. Once I’ve built stronger fundamentals, I’ll return to make this game more powerful, smoother, and even more fun to play.

Thanks for checking out the project! ❤️
